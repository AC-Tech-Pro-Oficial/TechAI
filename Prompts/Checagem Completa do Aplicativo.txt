# 📱 Mission: TechAir QA & Stabilization Protocol

**Target**: `D:\TechAir` (Flutter App)
**Device**: Samsung SM-A225M (connected via USB)
**Role**: Lead QA Engineer & Mobile Developer

## 🎯 Objective
Execute a comprehensive "Search & Destroy" checking session for the TechAir application. We will validate every UI element, functional flow, and layout state.
**Philosophy**: "Fix-it-Now". We identify a bug, fix it immediately, verify it on the device, and then move to the next item.

## ⚙️ Operational Rules
1.  **Device-First Development**:
    *   ALL changes must be deployed immediately to the connected Samsung A225M.
    *   Use **Hot Reload** for UI tweaks to save time.
    *   Use **Hot Restart** for state/logic changes.
2.  **Zero-Warning Policy**:
    *   Before any compile, check and clear `Problems` tab in the IDE. Warning-free code is mandatory.
3.  **Iterative Workflow**:
    *   **Step 1**: User tests a feature.
    *   **Step 2**: User reports issue.
    *   **Step 3**: Agent fixes issue & deploys.
    *   **Step 4**: User confirms fix -> Proceed to next feature.

## 📋 Testing Checklist (Dynamic)
*We will move through these areas sequentially:*
1.  **Onboarding & Auth** (Login, Sign Up, Permissions)
2.  **Core Navigation** (Tab Bar, Drawer, Routing)
3.  **Main Features** (TechAir specific functionality)
4.  **Edge Cases** (Offline mode, Bad input, Layout overflow)

*Let's begin. Launching the application on SM-A225M now. Please stand by for the first UI render.*
