# 🔬 Mission: Hosting Provider Technical Stress Test (Audit)

**Role**: Senior DevOps Engineer & Site Reliability Engineer (SRE)
**Context**: Following the initial selection (from Prompt 7), we need a deep-dive technical audit of the finalists.

## 🎯 Objective
Move beyond marketing claims. Verify the *actual* engineering limitations of the shortlisted providers (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, Firebase, AWS) specifically for the "AC Tech" ecosystem.

## 🧪 Audit Parameters (The "Hard Questions")

### 1. Infrastructure Introspection
*   **Cold Start Latency**: Research benchmarks for their Serverless Functions in `sa-east-1` (São Paulo).
*   **Edge Compute Limits**: specific CPU/RAM timeouts for the Free vs. Entry (R$ 10) tiers.
*   **DDOS Strategy**: What is included by default? (e.g., AWS Shield Standard vs Vercel Firewall).

### 2. Integration & Compliance
*   **CI/CD Pipeline Control**: Can we override the build commands? How granular are the logs?
*   **Monorepo Support**: How well do they handle a repository with `app/`, `api/`, and `docs/` folders?
*   **Vendor Lock-in Risk**: How hard is it to export our data/config if we leave?

### 3. "The R$ 10 Challenge"
*   Simulate a scaling event:
    *   If we hit 1TB bandwidth, which provider bankrupts us?
    *   If we have 1M requests/day, who throttles us first?
    *   Find the "Hidden Limits" (Inodes, Concurrent Builds, Bandwidth overage costs).

## 📄 Output: The Technical Due Diligence
Produce a **Risk & Capabilty Assessment**:
1.  **Red Flags**: Critical technical limitations found in fine-print.
2.  **Benchmark Data**: Real-world speed comparisons (Source reliable engineering blogs).
3.  **Migration Difficulty Score**: 1 (Easy) to 10 (Rewriting entire backend).
4.  **Final Recommendation**: The "Engineer's Choice" for safety and power.

*Focus on Technical Truth, not Marketing Features.*
