You will analyze and do a complete overhaul and redesign in our website. Modify each button and each  element. At the end, the features of the new website MUST be AT LEAST as good as the old ones. However "just as good" would be a sloppy terrible job, you should aim for "extensively improved" and implement a website that is centuries ahead the current one.

In order to redesign it properly, you need a deep analysis and comprehension of AC Tech, our products, what we will do with the company in the future etc.
I have summarized most of this information to you in the following text files (they are also attached):

Microsoft 365 Ultimate Installer - Comprehensive Tool Analysis

## 1. Project Overview & Utility

**Name:** Microsoft 365 Ultimate Installer (MUI)
**Type:** Automation Script / Utility
**Language:** PowerShell 5.1 / 7+ (with embedded C# / WPF)
**Repository:** github.com/AC-Tech-Pro-Oficial/Microsoft-Ultimate-Installer

The Microsoft Ultimate Installer is a "Power User" tool designed to solve the fatigue of setting up a new Windows environment. For IT professionals and the AC Tech founders themselves, formatting a computer is common, but the post-install setup (installing Office, Drivers, Browsers, VS Code, configuring privacy settings) is tedious and time-consuming. MUI automates this entire process into a single "One-Click" experience.

## 2. Technical Capabilities

The tool is a monolithic PowerShell script (`.ps1`) that acts as an orchestrator for various system tasks.

### A. Microsoft Office 365 Automation
This is the core feature.
*   **ODT Integration:** It wraps the official "Office Deployment Tool" (ODT). Instead of the user manually creating XML configuration files to specify which Office apps to install (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, but excluding Skype or Publisher), the script provides a GUI.
*   **Customization:** Users select exactly what they want via checkboxes. The script generates the dynamic XML config and triggers the ODT download and install in the background.
*   **Activation:** It integrates with the open-source MAS (Microsoft Activation Scripts) methods to ensure the installation is genuinely activated and ready for use.

### B. "The Debloater" (Windows Optimization)
Windows 10 and 11 come with significant "bloatware" (pre-installed apps, tracking services, advertising IDs).
*   **Cleanup:** The script executes deep system calls to remove Appx packages (like Candy Crush, Xbox Trial, automated news feeds) that slow down the system.
*   **Privacy:** It toggles registry keys to disable telemetry, advertising ID tracking, and background data collection, respecting the user's privacy hardcore.

### C. Software Repository (Package Management)
The tool acts as a "Store" for essential dev and power-user software.
*   **Silent Installers:** It downloads and silently installs tools like:
    *   **Browsers:** Chrome, Firefox, Brave.
    *   **Dev:** VS Code, Git, Node.js, Python.
    *   **Utilities:** 7-Zip, AnyDesk, WinRAR, Discord, Steam.
*   **Implementation:** It uses `winget` (Windows Package Manager) APIs and direct web scraping to fetch the latest versions invariably.

### D. Driver & Update Management
*   It can trigger the Windows Update service API to force-fetch drivers and critical security patches, ensuring the machine is patched up to the minute before the user even starts working.

## 3. UI/UX: The "WPF" Interface

Unlike most PowerShell scripts that run in a scary blue text window, MUI features a full Graphical User Interface (GUI).
*   **Technology:** It uses **WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)** via XAML code embedded directly inside the PowerShell script.
*   **Design:** Dark Mode, Acrylic (Blur) backgrounds, and modern controls. It looks like a native Windows 11 app, not a script.
*   **Status Feedback:** Real-time progress bars and log outputs keep the user informed of what is happening (e.g., "Downloading Office... 45%").

## 4. Operational Context

*   **Self-Elevation:** The script intelligently checks if it is running as Administrator. If not, it self-elevates, prompting the UAC (User Account Control) once, then runs unimpeded.
*   **Portability:** Being a single `.ps1` file, it can be carried on a USB stick or downloaded from GitHub and run instantly on any fresh machine without installing dependencies first.

## 5. Strategic Value

While primarily an internal utility for AC Tech maintenance, opening this project serves two purposes:
1.  **Community Contribution:** It helps the broader IT community, building reputation on GitHub.
2.  **Showcase:** It demonstrates mastery over strong Windows internals and PowerShell scripting, proving AC Tech's capability to manage OS-level automation, not just web/mobile apps.

## 6. Conclusion

The Microsoft Ultimate Installer is the ultimate "Force Multiplier" for the IT setup process. It turns a 4-hour manual configuration job into a 15-minute automated coffee break, embodying AC Tech's core mission of using technology to eliminate inefficiency.

Educacional AC Tech (Cognicir Language School) - Platform Analysis

## 1. Project Overview & Educational Vision

**Official Designation:** Educacional AC Tech / Cognicir Language School Portal
**URL:** educacional.ac-tech.pro
**Type:** Proprietary Learning Ecosystem
**Client:** Cognicir Language School (English Faculty)

This project represents AC Tech's deep dive into the **EdTech (Educational Technology)** sector. Moving beyond off-the-shelf solutions, AC Tech has developed a **bespoke, high-performance proprietary platform** specifically tailored for the long-term needs of a linguistic faculty. It is not just about "hosting videos"; it is about creating a digital campus that mirrors the structure, rigor, and community of a university.

**The "Professor" Persona:**
The platform is developed under a specific persona directive: "The Professor." The AI agents working on this project (within the `D:\Cognicir Language School\` context) adopt the voice of a wise, academic mentor. They do not speak in "code" or "bugs" but in "pedagogy," "linguistic roots," and "intellectual evolution." This philosophical separation ensures that the technology serves the education, not the other way around.

## 2. Infrastructure & Technology Stack

The platform is a powerhouse of integration, combining custom architecture with enterprise-grade storage and communication tools.

### A. Proprietary Core (The "Anti-LMS")
AC Tech has explicitly moved away from rigid, generic LMS solutions (like Moodle) to build a **Custom Educational Core**.
*   **Strategic Shift:** Moodle and similar platforms were deemed too "clunky" and "administrative" for the modern, high-fluidity experience AC Tech envisions.
*   **Custom Architecture:** By building their own platform, AC Tech maintains absolute control over the User Experience (UX). This allows for a unique, "Netflix-like" interface that generic LMS themes cannot emulate. It enables total freedom in feature implementation—from gamified progression systems to custom interactive widgets that behave exactly as the pedagogy requires, not as the software dictates.

### B. Video on Demand (VOD) - The "Netflix" of Learning
Video hosting is the most critical/expensive part of any EdTech project. AC Tech innovated by bypassing expensive dedicated video hosts (like Vimeo Enterprise) in favor of a clever integration.
*   **Google Drive Integration (2TB):** The system utilizes a massive 2TB Google Drive storage pool as the raw video backend.
*   **The Connector:** A specialized middleware acts as a bridge, streaming content from the secure Drive containers directly to the platform interface. This provides:
    1.  **Cost Efficiency:** Drastically lower costs compared to bitrate-based hosting.
    2.  **Organization:** Videos are managed in standard folders, making updates as easy as dragging and dropping a file.
    3.  **Capacity:** 2TB allows for thousands of hours of high-definition (1080p/4k) lesson content.

### C. Live Interaction (Synchronous Learning)
Education isn't just watching videos. The platform integrates **Jitsi Meet**, an open-source video conferencing server.
*   **Seamlessness:** Unlike Zoom or Teams which require external links, the Live Class system is embedded. A student clicks "Join Class" and the video window opens inside the portal context.
*   **Privacy:** No third-party data harvesting. The conversation stays between the professor and the student.

## 3. The "English Faculty" Curriculum Structure

The platform is structured to support a multi-year curriculum, divided into specific "Chapters" and "Classes."

**Content Hierarchy:**
*   **The Textbook (Typst):** AC Tech uses **Typst** (a modern, programmable typesetting system superior to LaTeX) to generate beautiful, PDF-based textbooks. These aren't just Word docs; they are professionally typeset books with perfect kerning, ligatures, and layouts.
*   **Interactive HTML Suite:** Each class is accompanied by a suite of web-based tools:
    *   **Lesson Plan:** The roadmap for the session.
    *   **Flashcards:** Digital repetition tools for vocabulary retention.
    *   **Workbook:** Interactive exercises.
    *   **Audio Lab:** Pronunciation practice tools.
    *   **The Game:** Gamified elements to reinforce learning through play.

## 4. Operational Automation

Maintaining a school involves administrative friction (enrollment, unlocking content, grading). AC Tech automates this.
*   **Agentic Content Generation:** The user (Professor) defines the "Theme" of a class (e.g., "The History of Time"). The `TechSearch` and `TechPlan` agents then research the topic, draft the textbook chapter, generate the quiz questions, and build the HTML interactive cards automatically.
*   **Deployment:** The content is pushed to the server via CI/CD pipelines, ensuring that a correction in a textbook file is reflected on the students' screens immediately.

## 5. Strategic Importance to AC Tech

Why does a "Tech" company run a "School"?
1.  **Proof of Concept:** It proves AC Tech can build complex, data-heavy web platforms, not just mobile apps.
2.  **Recurring Revenue:** Schools operate on subscriptions, providing stable cash flow.
3.  **Humanizing Tech:** It forces the developers to build for "Students" and "Teachers," not "Users" and "Admins," honing their UX/UI skills for non-technical audiences.

## 6. Conclusion

The Educacional AC Tech platform is a triumph of integration. It merges a custom-built, high-performance web architecture with the deep pedagogical needs of a language faculty. By owning the stack, AC Tech ensures that the limitation is never the software, but only the imagination of the teacher.

TechAI (TechAgents) - AC Tech's Agentic Artificial Intelligence Ecosystem

## 1. Project Overview & Philosophy

**Official Name:** TechAI (Internal designation: TechAgents)
**Status:** Active / Production Core
**Repository:** github.com/AC-Tech-Pro-Oficial/TechAI
**Integration:** VS Code Extension & Google Antigravity IDE

TechAI is not a single product; it is the "brain" and the "engine" behind AC Tech's operations. It represents the realization of the **"Agentic Swarm"** philosophy—the idea that a small team of humans can perform at the scale of a large enterprise by orchestrating a fleet of specialized AI agents.

While TechAir is the product sold to customers, **TechAI** is the product that *builds* the products. It has recently evolved from a set of scripts into a full-fledged **VS Code / Antigravity Extension**, bringing its capabilities directly into the developer's workspace.

## 2. The Agent Roster (The "Specialists")

The system is designed around distinct "Personas," each with a specific specialized rule set, prompt engineering context, and allowed tools. This prevents the "jack of all trades, master of none" problem common with generic AI chat.

*   **@TechAI (Chief of Staff):** The central router. All user requests start here. It analyzes the intent and routes the task to the appropriate specialist. It does not write code; it manages the team.
*   **@TechPlan (The Architect):** Uses **Claude 4.5 Opus** (known for superior reasoning). It researches, plans, and creates `implementation_plan.md` files. It thinks before anyone acts.
*   **@TechCode (The Builder):** Uses **Gemini 3 Pro** (known for speed and context window). It executes the plan, writing code, refactoring files, and fixing lints. It operates in a loop: Code -> Check Errors -> Fix -> Repeat.
*   **@TechTest (The Auditor):** The Quality Assurance agent. It writes unit tests, verifies security, and plays "Devil's Advocate" to find flaws in TechCode's work.
*   **@TechDesign (The Artist):** Specialized in UI/UX. It understands color theory, layout, and generates media assets using tools like Vertex AI or styling libraries (Flutter/CSS).
*   **@TechSearch (The Scholar):** A PhD-level researcher. It performs "Deep Research" (like this document), scouring the web and internal docs to provide ground-truth data.

## 3. Technical Architecture: The IDE Extension

TechAI has been encapsulated into a VS Code Extension (`.vsix`) to provide seamless integration into the Google Antigravity IDE.

*   **MCP Integration (Model Context Protocol):** TechAI heavily utilizes the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It runs a local MCP server that gives the AI agents diverse tools:
    *   *Firecrawl:* For scraping and understanding web documentation.
    *   *FileSystem:* For safe, authorized access to project files.
    *   *Memory:* Access to `Personal Context Memory.txt` and project rules.
*   **Command Palette Integration:** Developers can invoke agents via commands like `/techplan-create` or `/techcode-improve` directly from the editor.
*   **Context Injection:** The extension automatically injects the relevant "Project Rules" and "Global Manifesto" into every AI conversation, ensuring that no matter which model is used, it "knows" it works for AC Tech.

## 4. Local AI & Hybrid Architecture

A unique feature of the TechAI ecosystem is its **Hybrid Cloud/Local** approach.
*   **Cloud Brain:** Complex reasoning happens in the cloud (Claude Opus / Gemini Pro) for maximum intelligence.
*   **Local Muscle:** The system utilizes Moacir's local "Supercomputer" (RTX 4080) to run open-weights models (like DeepSeek-R1 or Qwen-2.5-Coder) via Ollama.
*   **Privacy & Cost:** Sensitive code or high-volume rote tasks can be offloaded to the local GPU, saving API costs and increasing privacy. The `delegate.ps1` script manages this handoff, allowing the Cloud Architect to command the Local Builder.

## 5. Security & Governance

TechAI is built with a "Zero-Trust" mindset regarding credentials.
*   **Credential Isolation:** API keys are never hardcoded. They live in a verified `Credentials` directory (`D:\TechAI\Credentials`), accessible only via secure file reading tools, never committed to Git.
*   **The "Warden" (TechRules):** An automated process that constantly scans all projects to ensure they are following the global standards (`agent.rules`). If a rule changes in the main TechAI hub, it propagates to all satellite projects (TechAir, Educacional, etc.) automatically.

## 6. Strategic Value

TechAI is AC Tech's competitive advantage.
1.  **Velocity:** It allows two founders to maintain 4+ complex projects simultaneously.
2.  **Consistency:** Every line of code, every documentation file, and every commit message follows the exact same standard, because the agents enforce it.
3.  **Knowledge Retention:** The "Brain" folder and context files ensure that knowledge isn't lost when a human forgets. The system "remembers" the architectural decisions made six months ago.

## 7. Conclusion

TechAI serves as the central nervous system of AC Tech. It transforms the chaotic process of software development into a structured, scalable, and highly efficient manufacturing line. By treating AI not as a chatbot but as a "colleague" with a specific job description, AC Tech has unlocked a level of productivity that defines their business model.

Firstly read EVERYTHING.

This was a lot of context but you should consider all of it. Redo your plan and propose design structures that are more relevant. Also, read the "TechAir Store Description" txt file that I provided, it contain important information about TechAir specifically that you can use in its sub menu page.

Your suggestion number 2 "Story-Driven Scroll" (positioning + depth) is definitely the one I like the most.
However, each AC Tech product should also tell its own story, also in a  comprehensive and qualitative way like this.

In addition, I think you should understand better the level of UI richness and complexity that I expect, so here goes a few examples of websites to inspire:
https://lusion.co/
https://bruno-simon/
https://activetheory.net/
https://cornrevolution.resn.global/#result

HOWEVER: our website MUST have this level of quality for ALL website, not just in the home page.

Finally, make sure our website has at LEAST the same level of resources and complexity, but at a much larger scale, in all different menus, sub domains etc.
