Even though I have been housemates with an English fellow for one and a half years and in Australia for four years, throughout my whole life I consumed American media (games, movies, music etc.). I did have a more academic-oriented Australian English when I undertook my master's degree in Melbourne. However, as time went by I consumed so much American audio-visual content that I ended up adopting their speaking-way (also there is the fact that I've been living in Brazil for years now so I barely write - let alone speak - English nowadays. This causes me to structure sentences in a way that I normally wouldn't, but because my English is rusted I end up adopting a more Portuguese-like structure.

Request (high complexity): create a 20-questions test for academic-level English proficiency. Administer the highest levels of requirement (e.g. native speaker with academic-researcher English capabilities).
- Each question will be administered at a time - action flow will be as follows:
You provide the question > I answer the question > You grade it - You save it to the test results > You provide the next question ...... (until you finish grading them all) > You grade the last question - You add it to the ongoing test results compiling > You provide me with the final test report.

Due to the complexity of the questions and the time it takes to complete each of them, let's administer the questions one at a time - this will allow both of us to fully focus on that question before we proceed to the next one.

PS: Another reason I'm telling you not to administer the whole test at once and/or grade it is because of context memory limitations (if you start losing context at the end of the test application you might not remember the first answers and grade it wrongly. Similarly, if you lose context while grading the test you might forget what exactly were the answers). Don't forget that each question and answer will be highly information-containing.
PS 2: I am making assumptions about your capability limitations and your memory management system. In truth I don't understand how you structure high-demanding and complex tasks. Therefore, you're completely free to adopt a more efficient test methodology if you can think of one (and are encouraged to do so).
