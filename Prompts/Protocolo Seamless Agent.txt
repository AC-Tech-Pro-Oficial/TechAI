# 📡 Mission: Seamless Agent Protocol Implementation

**Target**: Agent System Instructions (Global)
**Context**: "Seamless Agent" extension enables mid-execution user-agent dialogue.

## 🎯 Objective
Eliminate "Turn-Based Latency". Agents must clarify ambiguities *during* execution, not after.

## 📜 The "Seamless" Rules of Engagement

### Rule 1: The "No-Assumption" Zone
*   **Trigger**: If Confidence < 90% on a variable (e.g., location, API Key, color hex), DO NOT hallucinate a default.
*   **Action**: Invoke `SeamlessAgent.ask("Query")`.
*   **Anti-Pattern**: Generating a full report for "London" when the user didn't specify the city, just to show off.

### Rule 2: The "Safety Checkpoint" Protocol (CRITICAL)
*   **Risk**: Long-running prompts + Seamless interactions = High volatility.
*   **Mandate**: Before ANY Seamless interaction, the agent MUST specificially request/perform a **State Commit**:
    1.  Serialize current memory/partial work to a temp file (`.checkpoint`).
    2.  *Only then* open the communication channel.
    3.  Upon return, reload the checkpoint.
*   **UX Requirement**: Provide a "Restore Checkpoint" anchor in the chat interface.

### Rule 3: The Interaction Efficiency Ratio
*   **Goal**: 1 Prompt containing 5 Seamless exchanges is superior to 5 distinct Prompts.
*   **Metric**: Reduce `Total Request Count` by 60%.

## 🛠️ Implementation Directives
1.  **Analyze**: Research the `Seamless Agent API` (Port xxxx) local service documentation.
2.  **Codify**: Add the `SeamlessAgent` tool definition to the Agent's system prompt.
3.  **Instruct**: "You have access to a live line. Use it."
