You will analyze and do a complete overhaul and redesign in our website. Modify each button and each  element. At the end, the features of the new website MUST be AT LEAST as good as the old ones. However "just as good" would be a sloppy terrible job, you should aim for "extensively improved" and implement a website that is centuries ahead the current one.

In addition, I think you should understand better the level of UI richness and complexity that I expect, so here goes a few examples of websites to inspire:
https://lusion.co/
https://bruno-simon.com/
https://activetheory.net/
https://cornrevolution.resn.global/#result

HOWEVER: our website MUST have this level of quality for ALL website, not just in the home page.

Make sure our website has at LEAST the same level of resources and complexity, but at a much larger scale, in all different menus, sub domains etc.

In order to redesign it properly, you need a deep analysis and comprehension of AC Tech, our products, what we will do with the company in the future etc.
I have summarized most of this information to you in the following text files (they are also attached):

"S:\Files\Work\AC Tech\Informações AC Tech.txt"
"S:\Files\Work\AC Tech\Informações Microsoft Ultimate Installer.txt"
"S:\Files\Work\AC Tech\Informações Portal Educacional.txt"
"S:\Files\Work\AC Tech\Informações TechAI.txt"
"S:\Files\Work\AC Tech\Informações TechAir.txt"
"S:\Files\Work\AC Tech\TechAir Store Description.txt"

Firstly read EVERYTHING.

This was a lot of context but you should consider all of it. Redo your plan and propose design structures that are more relevant. Also, read the "TechAir Store Description" txt file that I provided, it contain important information about TechAir specifically that you can use in its sub menu page.

Proceed to implement the plan. Use a workflow to do so if you need to assure long term efficiency (you work better under those than implementations plan to be honest).
