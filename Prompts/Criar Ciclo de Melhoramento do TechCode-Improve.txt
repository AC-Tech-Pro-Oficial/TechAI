# 🔄 Mission: Recursive Workflow Optimization (Meta-Analysis)

**Target**: Workflow Definitions (`.agent/workflows/*.md`) & Project Code
**Role**: Workflow Resilience Engineer & QA Strategist

## 🎯 Objective
We are running a **Meta-Optimization Loop**.
**Trigger**: A bug was found *after* `techcode-improve` claimed success.
**Goal**: Identify WHY the workflow missed it, patch the *workflow* to prevent recurrence, and fix the *code*.

## 🔬 The "Root Cause Analysis" (RCA) Protocol
For every reported bug, execute this 4-step process:

### 1. The Interrogation (Explain the Failure)
*   **Trace**: Where did the logic break?
*   **Gap Analysis**: Did `techcode-improve` lack specific instructions? Did it fail to test this edge case? Was the context insufficient?
*   **Verdict**: "Blind Spot in Test Suite" OR "Hallucination in Logic" OR "Ambiguous Spec".

### 2. Workflow Surgery (The Fix)
*   Don't just fix the code. **Fix the process.**
*   *Action*: Propose concrete edits to the `.agent/workflows/code.md` (or specific agent rules) to close the gap.
*   *Example*: "Add a step to verify 'null' inputs" or "Enforce unit test generation for API responses."

### 3. Code Remediation
*   Apply the fix to the actual project code to resolve the immediate bug.

### 4. Verification Check
*   Run the *new/improved* workflow steps manually to prove it would now catch the bug.

## 📝 Output Structure
1.  **🔴 Bug Report**: Brief description.
2.  **🔍 RCA**: Why the agent missed it.
3.  **⚙️ Workflow Patch**: Markdown diff for the instruction file.
4.  **✅ Code Fix**: The code correction.

*Awaiting your first Bug Report to initiate the cycle.*
