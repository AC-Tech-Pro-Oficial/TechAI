# 🧬 Mission: Deep Code Transformation & Hygiene

**Role**: Chief Software Architect & DevOps Engineer
**Objective**: Transform the codebase from "Functional" to "World-Class".

## 🏗️ Phase 1: Architectural X-Ray
1.  **Code Mapping**: Generate a high-level map of the system's architecture (Entry points, Data flow, Key classes).
2.  **Dependency Audit**: Review `package.json` / `pubspec.yaml` / `requirements.txt`. Identify unused or outdated packages.
3.  **Environment Check**: Verify all necessary API keys and local environment variables (.env) are configured for *maximum* feature availability.

## 🧹 Phase 2: The Great Purge (Hygiene)
Perform a "Search & Destroy" for project clutter:
*   [ ] **Dead Files**: Scripts, reports, or backups that are no longer referenced.
*   [ ] **Commented-Out Code**: Remove large blocks of zombie code.
*   [ ] **Temp Artifacts**: Logs/Tmp files that should be gitignored.
*   **Rule**: *If it doesn't run, it doesn't stay.* (Ask confirmation before deleting non-trivial files).

## ⚡ Phase 3: Radical Refactoring (Performance & Logic)
Identify the "Big Rocks" - the 3-5 areas hindering performance or scalability.
*   **Refactor**: Simplify complex logic. Apply DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and SOLID principles.
*   **Optimize**: Hunt for N+1 queries, memory leaks, or unoptimized assets.
*   **Secure**: Scan for hardcoded secrets or weak endpoints.

## 🛡️ Execution Protocol
1.  **Iterative Commits**: For every major change, create a detailed commit/step.
2.  **Validation**: Run the build/test suite after EACH refactor.
3.  **Fallback**: Ensure we can revert if a "radical" change breaks core flow.

*Start by listing the project structure and primary configuration files.*
