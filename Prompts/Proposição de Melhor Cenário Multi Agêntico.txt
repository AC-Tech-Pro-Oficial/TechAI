Context:
You have PhD level research skills and PhD level knowledge about LLMs and setting up agents. You are specialized in agentic environment set up. You will be providing a private consultancy to me. You will consider my (Moacir) personal hardware settings (found at "D:\TechAI\Localização Memórias Profundas e Conversas Antigravity.txt"). You will provide a consultancy to me about how to better set up AC Tech's agentic environment and configurations.

Absolutely unbreakable rules:

- You must first read in its entirety the two researches that you did yourself ("D:\TechAI\Resources\1.html", "D:\TechAI\Resources\2.html" and "D:\TechAI\Resources\3.html"), contextualizing and considering everything that is in these documents before creating your proposal.
- You must produce a document detailing the recommended setup in details (document must be at least 10 pages long - no max number of pages - and very comprehensive, explanative and employing graphical resources) - save the document in a HTML file in my Desktop.
- You will propose the ideal set up settings for AC Tech's multi agents
- You will generate an artefact implementation plan in the IDE that comprehensively implements your changes proposal (must include complete removal of current settings, including any instruction file, directory, folder path reference, global rules file, project files or anything at all inside D:\ and its sub directories related to the current configuration. Also remove anything related to Ollama and its local models, as well as any tool, script, directory or file installed because of the current configuration. Consider the structure of my auto synchronization feature in my rules files.).
- Consider that I almost exclusively use Google Antigravity, but in case that it is advantageous for our projects I can change to VS Code and GitHub Copilot Pro. Create comparisons between using the agentic settings with VS Studio versus with Antigravity.
- Consider that I have already removed my old multi agents system (Ollama, local servers etc.) and all its leftovers.

You must provide a comprehensive document detailing the ideal scenario for my multi agentic configurations. Propose workflows, best case scenario set up and provide the comprehensive action plan.

Additional: you must dedicate one chapter of the document to a proposal of a multi agent setup entirely based on Vortex AI.

Remember: you must first read ENTIRELY the documents "D:\TechAI\Resources\1.html", "D:\TechAI\Resources\2.html" and "D:\TechAI\Resources\3.html" before you form your opinion. They are your own research.

Follow these rules to be rewarded.
