# 📊 Mission: Cloud Infrastructure Strategy (Hosting Comparison)

**Role**: Chief Technology Officer (CTO) & Cloud Architect
**Objective**: Select the optimal hosting provider for AC Tech's future-proof ecosystem.
**Philosophy**: "Quality > Difficulty". We accept complexity if it yields "State of the Art" performance.

## 📋 The Decision Criteria

### 1. Mandatory Constraints
*   **Budget**: Must offer an entry-level plan ≤ **R$ 10.00/month** (or a generous Free Tier).
*   **Scalability**: Must support subdomains (`app.ac-tech.pro`, `api.ac-tech.pro`) and future microservices.
*   **Flexibility**: Full support for modern frameworks (React/Next.js/Flutter Web) and "Top Tier" design capabilities (no drag-and-drop builders unless they offer total code control).

### 2. Evaluation Metrics (The "Deep Dive")
Compare candidates (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, DigitalOcean, AWS Free Tier, Hostinger, Firebase) on:
*   **Performance**: Edge Network/CDN availability in South America (Latency check).
*   **DX (Developer Experience)**: CI/CD integration quality, CLI tools, Deployment speed.
*   **Ecosystem**: Native support for Serverless Functions, Databases, and Auth.
*   **Long-Term Viability**: Pricing cliff (how expensive does it get when we scale?).

## 📝 Deliverable: The Strategy Report
Create a comprehensive **Decision Matrix Artifact** containing:
1.  **Executive Summary**: The top recommendation vs. runner-up.
2.  **Detailed Comparison Table**: Feature-by-feature breakdown.
3.  **Scenario Analysis**:
    *   *Scenario A*: rapid prototyping (Free tier).
    *   *Scenario B*: 10k monthly users + Database.
    *   *Scenario C*: "AC Tech Ultimate" (Full ecosystem).
4.  **Verdict**: A definitive choice backed by technical evidence.

*Produce a report that justifies the decision with potential for 5-Year scaling, not just today's needs.*
