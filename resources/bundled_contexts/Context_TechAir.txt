TechAir App - Comprehensive Product Analysis & Feature Breakdown

## 1. Product Overview & Strategic Purpose

**Name:** TechAir (Professional)
**Platform:** Flutter (iOS & Android) - Cross-Platform Architecture
**Target Audience:** HVAC-R Professionals (Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning, and Refrigeration), Electrical Technicians, and Service Providers.
**Core Value Proposition:** "Your Office in Your Pocket."
**Local Path:** D:\TechAir
**Repository:** github.com/AC-Tech-Pro-Oficial/TechAir
**Account:** contato@ac-tech.pro

TechAir is AC Tech's flagship product, designed to address a critical pain point in the technical service industry: the lack of professional structure among independent technicians and small providers. In Brazil, many technicians operate informally, relying on paper pads for quotes and WhatsApp for communication. TechAir professionalizes this process by providing a suite of digital tools that rival those of large engineering firms. It transforms an individual technician into a structured "company" capable of issuing legal documents (PMOC) and professional PDF proposals.

## 2. Technical Architecture

*   **Framework:** Built on **Flutter**, ensuring a native-like experience at 120Hz on both Android and iOS devices. The design language is strictly modern, utilizing glassmorphism, dark modes, and fluid animations to convey a premium feel.
*   **Backend:** Leverages **Firebase** (Project: ac-tech-pro) for real-time database synchronization, authentication (Auth), and cloud storage. This ensures that a technician's data is safe in the cloud—if they lose their phone, they don't lose their business.
*   **AI Integration:** The app integrates Google Gemini models ("TechAir AI") to provide intelligent assistance, such as analyzing photos of equipment plates to extract model numbers or suggesting fixes for error codes.

## 5. Detailed Feature Breakdown (Menu by Menu)

Based on the application's source structure (`lib/features/`) and public documentation, the application is divided into several powerful modules. Each module acts as a standalone tool but is fully integrated into the central ecosystem.

### A. Dashboard (Home)
The command center of the application.
*   **Purpose:** Provides an "at-a-glance" view of the business health.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   **Quick Actions:** One-tap access to create a new quote or service order.
    *   **Status Overview:** Visual indicators of pending jobs, approved quotes, and monthly revenue.
    *   **Notifications:** Alerts for upcoming scheduled maintenance (PMOC) or client follow-ups.

### B. Quotes & Estimates (Orçamentos)
Located in `lib/features/orcamentos`. This is often the primary driver of sales for users.
*   **Functionality:** Allows the creation of detailed, itemized service proposals in seconds.
*   **The "Wow" Factor:** Unlike a simple text message, TechAir generates a branded PDF document.
*   **Capabilities:**
    *   **Itemization:** Add parts, labor, and travel costs separately.
    *   **Customization:** Add the technician's logo and company details automatically.
    *   **PDF Generation:** One-click export to WhatsApp or Email. The PDF is clean, professional, and contractually sound.
    *   **Status Tracking:** Mark quotes as "Sent," "Viewed," "Approved," or "Rejected."

### C. Digital Service Orders (O.S. Digital)
Located in `lib/features/os`. The operational core of daily work.
*   **Purpose:** Replaces the carbon-copy paper pads used for decades.
*   **Workflow:**
    *   **Check-in:** Technician creates an O.S. upon arrival.
    *   **Documentation:** Ability to attach photos of the equipment *before* and *after* service (crucial for proof of work).
    *   **Checklist:** Pre-defined service steps to ensure quality (e.g., "Check gas pressure," "Clean filters").
    *   **Digital Signature:** The client signs directly on the phone screen using their finger.
    *   **History:** The O.S. is saved to the client's profile for future reference.

### D. PMOC Generator (Regulatory Compliance)
A massive selling point in the Brazilian market. PMOC (Plano de Manutenção, Operação e Controle) is required by law (Lei 13.589/2018) for many air conditioned environments.
*   **The Pain Point:** Drafting a PMOC manually is tedious, technical, and prone to legal errors.
*   **The TechAir Solution:** An automated generator that creates a compliant legal document based on the equipment data entered.
*   **Features:**
    *   **Schedule Management:** Automatically reminds the technician (and client) of monthly, quarterly, and annual maintenance tasks.
    *   **Legal Validity:** Generates documents ready for inspection by ANVISA (Health Surveillance Agency).
    *   **Recurring Revenue:** Encourages technicians to sell "maintenance contracts" rather than just one-off repairs.

### E. Financial Hub (Financeiro)
Located in `lib/features/financeiro`. The "CFO" of the small business.
*   **Purpose:** Move technicians away from mixing personal and business finances.
*   **Features:**
    *   **Cash Flow:** Tracks inflows (Service Payments) and outflows (Parts, Gas, Fuel).
    *   **Profitability Analysis:** Calculates the profit margin per job.
    *   **Reports:** Monthly visual charts showing growth trends.
    *   **Payment Methods:** Records whether payment was Cash, Pix, Credit Card, or Boleto.

### F. Client Management (Clientes)
Located in `lib/features/clientes`.
*   **CRM (Customer Relationship Management):** A dedicated database of all customers.
*   **Asset Management:** Unlike a generic phonebook, this links "Equipment" to "Clients."
    *   *Example:* Accessing "Mrs. Silva" shows she has two Samsung Split ACs installed in 2023.
*   **Geolocation:** Integration with Maps to navigate to the client's address.

### G. Inventory Control (Estoque)
Located in `lib/features/estoque`.
*   **Purpose:** Prevents the "I forgot the part" problem.
*   **Tracking:** Manages stock of refrigerants (R410A, R32), copper pipes, capacitors, and spare parts.
*   **Alerts:** Low-stock warnings when critical items (like gas) are running low.

### H. Augmented Reality Tools (AR)
Located in `lib/features/ar`. The "High-Tech" differentiator.
*   **Function:** uses the phone's camera and ARCore/ARKit.
*   **Use Cases:**
    *   **Virtual Placement:** Visualize how a specific AC unit (Split, Cassette) will look on the client's wall before drilling even one hole.
    *   **Measurement:** Measure distances and pipe runs using the camera, avoiding the need for ladders in preliminary visits.

### I. Technical Calculators (Serviços/Tools)
Located in `lib/features/servicos` or shared tools.
*   **BTU Calculator (Carga Térmica):** A wizard that asks about room size, windows, sun exposure, and electronics to recommend the *exact* BTU capacity needed. This prevents under-cooling or energy waste.
*   **Piping Dimensioning:** Calculates the correct diameter for copper lines based on machine distance.
*   **Fluid Tables:** Digital "Slider" for Pressure x Temperature conversion for all major refrigerants (R22, R410A, R32, R134a).

### J. Authentication & Security (Auth)
Located in `lib/features/auth`.
*   **Security:** Multi-factor capability (Email/Password + Biometrics).
*   **Cloud Sync:** Ensures the user's account is their key. Logging in on a new device restores everything instantly.

## 6. Artificial Intelligence (TechAir AI)

TechAir is not just a database; it is intelligent.
*   **Diagnostic Assistant:** "I have a Midea Inverter showing Error E4." -> AI analyzes and suggests: "Open sensor circuit. Check outdoor unit sensor."
*   **Image Analysis:** "Take a photo of the nameplate." -> AI OCR extracts the Serial Number, Model, and Voltage, auto-filling the equipment registration form.

## 7. Assets Location

*   **Images:** `D:\Assets\Images\TechAir\`
*   **Videos:** `D:\Assets\Videos\TechAir\`

## 8. Conclusion

TechAir is a comprehensive ecosystem. It replaces:
1.  The Note Pad (Quotes)
2.  The Calculator (BTU/Electrical math)
3.  The Agenda (Scheduling)
4.  The Spreadsheet (Finance)
5.  The Filing Cabinet (Client History)

By consolidating these into a single, premium Flutter application, AC Tech provides the "Operating System" for the modern HVAC professional.
