TechAI (TechAgents) - AC Tech's Agentic Artificial Intelligence Ecosystem

## 1. Project Overview & Philosophy

**Official Name:** TechAI (Internal designation: TechAgents)
**Status:** Active / Production Core
**Repository:** github.com/AC-Tech-Pro-Oficial/TechAI
**Integration:** VS Code Extension & Google Antigravity IDE
**Local Path:** D:\TechAI

TechAI is not a single product; it is the "brain" and the "engine" behind AC Tech's operations. It represents the realization of the **"Agentic Swarm"** philosophy—the idea that a small team of humans can perform at the scale of a large enterprise by orchestrating a fleet of specialized AI agents.

While TechAir is the product sold to customers, **TechAI** is the product that *builds* the products. It has recently evolved from a set of scripts into a full-fledged **VS Code / Antigravity Extension**, bringing its capabilities directly into the developer's workspace.

## 2. The Agent Roster (The "Specialists")

The system is designed around distinct "Personas," each with a specific specialized rule set, prompt engineering context, and allowed tools. This prevents the "jack of all trades, master of none" problem common with generic AI chat.

*   **@TechAI (Chief of Staff):** The central router. All user requests start here. It analyzes the intent and routes the task to the appropriate specialist. It does not write code; it manages the team.
*   **@TechPlan (The Architect):** Uses **Claude 4.5 Opus** (known for superior reasoning). It researches, plans, and creates `implementation_plan.md` files. It thinks before anyone acts.
*   **@TechCode (The Builder):** Uses **Gemini 3 Pro** (known for speed and context window). It executes the plan, writing code, refactoring files, and fixing lints. It operates in a loop: Code -> Check Errors -> Fix -> Repeat.
*   **@TechTest (The Auditor):** The Quality Assurance agent. It writes unit tests, verifies security, and plays "Devil's Advocate" to find flaws in TechCode's work.
*   **@TechDesign (The Artist):** Specialized in UI/UX. It understands color theory, layout, and generates media assets using tools like Vertex AI or styling libraries (Flutter/CSS).
*   **@TechSearch (The Scholar):** A PhD-level researcher. It performs "Deep Research" (like this document), scouring the web and internal docs to provide ground-truth data.

## 3. Technical Architecture: The IDE Extension

TechAI has been encapsulated into a VS Code Extension (`.vsix`) to provide seamless integration into the Google Antigravity IDE.

*   **MCP Integration (Model Context Protocol):** TechAI heavily utilizes the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It runs a local MCP server that gives the AI agents diverse tools:
    *   *Firecrawl:* For scraping and understanding web documentation.
    *   *FileSystem:* For safe, authorized access to project files.
    *   *Memory:* Access to Context files and project rules.
*   **Command Palette Integration:** Developers can invoke agents via commands like `/techplan-create` or `/techcode-improve` directly from the editor.
*   **Context Injection:** The extension automatically injects the relevant "Project Rules" and "Global Manifesto" into every AI conversation, ensuring that no matter which model is used, it "knows" it works for AC Tech.

## 5. Local AI & Hybrid Architecture

A unique feature of the TechAI ecosystem is its **Hybrid Cloud/Local** approach.
*   **Cloud Brain:** Complex reasoning happens in the cloud (Claude Opus / Gemini Pro) for maximum intelligence.
*   **Local Muscle:** The system can utilize Moacir's local "Supercomputer" (RTX 4080) to run open-weights models (like DeepSeek-R1 or Qwen-2.5-Coder) via Ollama.
*   **Privacy & Cost:** Sensitive code or high-volume rote tasks can be offloaded to the local GPU, saving API costs and increasing privacy.

## 6. Security & Governance

TechAI is built with a "Zero-Trust" mindset regarding credentials.
*   **Credential Isolation:** API keys are never hardcoded. They live in a verified `Credentials` directory (`D:\TechAI\Credentials`), accessible only via secure file reading tools, never committed to Git.
*   **The "Warden" (TechRules):** An automated process that constantly scans all projects to ensure they are following the global standards (`agent.rules`). If a rule changes in the main TechAI hub, it propagates to all satellite projects (TechAir, AC Educacional, etc.) automatically via the `/sync` workflow.

## 7. Assets Location

IDE Extension VSIX files are stored in the centralized assets directory:
*   **Location:** `D:\Assets\IDE Extensions\TechAI.vsix`
*   **Images:** `D:\Assets\Images\TechAI\`
*   **Videos:** `D:\Assets\Videos\TechAI\`

## 8. Strategic Value

TechAI is AC Tech's competitive advantage.
1.  **Velocity:** It allows two founders to maintain 4+ complex projects simultaneously.
2.  **Consistency:** Every line of code, every documentation file, and every commit message follows the exact same standard, because the agents enforce it.
3.  **Knowledge Retention:** The Contexts folder and context files ensure that knowledge isn't lost when a human forgets. The system "remembers" the architectural decisions made months ago.

## 9. Conclusion

TechAI serves as the central nervous system of AC Tech. It transforms the chaotic process of software development into a structured, scalable, and highly efficient manufacturing line. By treating AI not as a chatbot but as a "colleague" with a specific job description, AC Tech has unlocked a level of productivity that defines their business model.
